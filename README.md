# CLDE-CapstoneProject
Name of project : Age & Gender Detection using Convolutional Neural Network
Description of the project : To classify the age group (year range) and gender of people based on the face images
Input and output information : The input is the image from the webcam, the output is the information of the age and gender for the image
Motivation of the idea : The reliability of the existing solutions remains insufficient for practical applications in various fields
Data Set Sources : Adience dataset
Network Description : 3 Convolution layer, 2 Normalization layer, 3 Max Pooling Layer, 2 Fully connected layer, 1 dropout layer

Recall = 0.1743
F1 Score = 0.1843
Model Training for Gender Detection :
Accuracy = 0.4991
Precision = 0
Recall = 0
F1 Score = 0
Model Testing for Age Detection :
Accuracy = 0.18
Precision = 0.113
